msgpack-smalltalk
=================

MessagePack serialization library for various Smalltalk dialects.

We are moving from [Google Code site](http://code.google.com/p/messagepack-st/). Old contents are still there.

Currently, we have just put a [Cypress](https://github.com/CampSmalltalk/Cypress/blob/master/README.md)-based repository for the neutral accesses from various Smalltalk dialects.
